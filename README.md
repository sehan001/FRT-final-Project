## Problem-statement:
Travelers must visit every city on a list of cities, where the distances between each city are known, and each city must only be visited once. When you decide to lead a life of travel, you must realize that things won't always go as to plan. Some travel arrangements go off without a hitch, but many don't. While certain things may be planned for, others can only be responded to when travelling.
